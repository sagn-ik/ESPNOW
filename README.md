The mac id of the reciever needs to be fetched by uploading the "macfetch.ino" and opening the serial moniter at the given baud rate. Here ESP NOW communication is used to setup a automatic pump controller, where the receiver is placed near the pump with the relay connected to its D4 pin, and the transmitter near the tank, whee water is filled. In the transmitter, 2 probes are taken and dipped into the tank at the desired level. the probes are connected to pin D4 and GND respectively.
